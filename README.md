## Multiple Vagrant Environments for Puppet Module development and testing

This will not utilize the normal puppet vagrant provisioner.  This will
install the latest puppet release and build a Master and an Agent for
testing in production-like environments.

The following environments are available:
* CentOS 6
* CentOS 5
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Multi

## Multi

The multi environment allows for n number of agents to be build with the
INSTANCES=n variable.  NOTE: This will be limited to the amount of RAM so
be cautious building a lot of nodes.


## Requirements
The following plugins are suggested, especially if using the Multi setup:

* vagrant-hosts
